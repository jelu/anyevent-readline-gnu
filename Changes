1.0  Fri May 11 17:37:36 CEST 2012
        - make sure any readline adornment is off even on first redisplay.
	- added caveat section.
        - fix "support" url.

0.2  Thu May 10 23:52:21 CEST 2012
	- the SYNOPSIS used cb instead of the correct
          on_line parameter name.
        - postpone the invocation of the on_line callback as readline
          is not yet in a "new line" state when calling the callback.
        - pass point position to callback.
        - accept both cb and on_line for callback, croak if
          both are missing.
        - clarify encoding.

Description: AnyEvent::ReadLine::Gnu
 The Term::ReadLine module family is bizarre (and you are encouraged not to
 look at its sources unless you want to go blind). It does support event-based
 operations, somehow, but it's hard to figure out.
 .
 It also has some utility functions for printing messages asynchronously,
 something that, again, isn't obvious how to do.
 .
 AnyEvent::ReadLine::Gnu has figured it all out for you, once and for all.
